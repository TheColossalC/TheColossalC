-  Hi, I’m @TheColossalC
-  I’m interested in power/natural gas trading (though wouldn't be opposed to a stock market/crude oil/metals swap) and advanced, yet appropriate/appropriate statistical analysis tools to better understand and explain bigdata.
-  I’m currently learning what aspects of the market can be modeled (and for how long before being outdated) and how to leverage this into statistically advantaged trades that at least make money in an infinitely sized sample size
-  This profile is more just a place to share the coding and programming support I've done solo or been a sizable contributation to, and so I can browse other people's work for inspiration on ideas
